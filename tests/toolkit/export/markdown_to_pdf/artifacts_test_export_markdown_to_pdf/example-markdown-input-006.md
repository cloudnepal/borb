# Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

## Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (\-), asterisks (\*), or plus signs (\+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Unordered Lists (2)

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

## Unordered Lists (3)

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item

## Unordered Lists (4)

- First item
- Second item
    - Indented item
- Third item

### Unordered List Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.

### Adding Elements in Lists
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.
    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.
* And here's the third list item.
